\chapter*{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)}

Multi-agent black-box optimization framework inspired by
social and roosting behavior of flocking birds

\section*{Background: Boids!}

Realistic model of coordinated animal motion, agents follow three simple rules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
    \item Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates 
    \item Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates
\end{enumerate}

Later, a \textbf{roost} was added. An attraction point in a simplified
Boids-like simulation, such that each agent

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is attracted to the location of the roost 
    \item Remembers where it was closer to it 
    \item Tells its gang about its closest location to the roost
\end{enumerate}

Eventually, (almost) all agents will land on the roost.

What if the roost is the unknown global optimum (min/max) of a mathematical 
function? And the "distance to the roost" is simply the quality of the function's value at that point?

\section*{Black-box optimization with PSO}

We do not know the formula for $f(x)$. All we can do is 
"query" the function: provide an input $x$ and observe the output $f(x)$. 
We must find the optimum by intelligently sampling the search space.

PSO is a derivative-free, black-box optimization algorithm.

\section*{Core Mechanic (In Words)}

Swarm of particles are made, each particle $i$ represents a potential solution. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Position $\xx_i \in \Rn$: Candidate solution of particle
    \item Velocity $\vv_i \in \Rn$: Current direction and speed of particle 
\end{itemize}

Each particle also has a memory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item pbest, position with the best $f(x)$ particle $i$ ever visited
    \item gbest, position with the best $f(x)$ any particle ever visited
\end{itemize}

At each time step, the particle updates its velocity and position based on 
3 influences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inertia component: keep going where its going already
    \item Personal component: pull towards pbest 
    \item Social Component: pull towards gbest 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Core Mechanic (In Math) :)}
\textbf{Velocity Update:} 
\[
\vv_i(t+1) = \omega \vv_i(t) + c_1 r_1 (pbest_i - \xx_i(t)) + c_2 r_2 (gbest_i - \xx_i(t))
\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\omega$ is inertia weight (influence of old velocity)
    \item $c_1,c_2$ are acceleration coefficients (weighting the "pull" of the personal and social components).
    \item $r_1,r_2$ are random numbers, adding stochasticity to the search.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Position Update:} 
Just move. 
\[
\xx_i(t+1) = \xx_i(t) + \vv_i(t+1)
\]

\section*{Parameters and Variants}

\textbf{What if only one agent?}
If left alone, each individual agent would behave like a stochastic hill-climber when moving
in the direction of a local optimum, and then it will have a quite hard time to escape it
