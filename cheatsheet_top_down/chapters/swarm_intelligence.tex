\textbf{Swarm Intelligence} is the study and design of Complex Systems/ 
Multi-Agent Systems that 
\begin{tightitemize}
    \item Potentically large number of locally interacting, decentralized,
    and distributed components, a swarm 
    \item Each component has a purpose that contributes to the peformance of 
    the whole
    \item Under some condiitons, the system displays emergent forms of 
    collective / swarm intelligence
\end{tightitemize}

The method of communication defines the type of SI system:

\begin{tightitemize}
    \item Point-to-Point: Direct contact (e.g., ant antennation).
    \item Limited-Range Broadcast: A signal propagates locally (e.g., fish lateral lines detecting waves, visual cues).
    \item Indirect (Stigmergy): An agent modifies the environment, and another agent responds to that change later.
    \item Physical Mobility: Agents move through space,
    and their "network" is their set of current neighbors, which changes constantly.
    \item Static positioning, state evolution: connection topology and/or 
    positioning in the environment do not change over time.
